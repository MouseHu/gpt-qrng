#  I don't believe it can't be done. It doesn't make sense.

- You should be able to overfit the dataset if the dataset is very small. But currently, it is not overfitting, even with a small dataset.
- you should observe grokking when overfitting a small dataset.
- You should be able to detect patterns in MTRNG, and we have shown it is possible to do so.
- Transformer is powerful. You should understand it better. Tame the monster. Make sure it works on a normal dataset, then try it with MTRNG. Finally QRNG.


# First generate data


# Then train with gpt. 

Note to maximize performance of 3090 or Xi'an server.
